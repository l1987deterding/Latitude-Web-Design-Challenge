# Web-Design-Challenge
Bootcamp Homework over HTML and CSS
Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

This site contains:

A landing page (landing.html) with an explanation of the project, links to each visualizations page, a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image takes the user to that visualization.

Four visualization pages, which you can access under "Plots" in the navigation bar, each with:

A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.


A "Comparisons" page that:

Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

A "Data" page that:

Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.


The website, at the top of every page, has a navigation menu that:

Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots "Navigation Menu" section (notice the background color change).
